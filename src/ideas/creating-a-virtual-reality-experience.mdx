## What Are Virtual Reality Experiences?

Virtual reality (VR) experiences immerse viewers in a 3D world, letting them look around and interact as if they’re really there. On YouTube, this can mean:

- 360-degree videos (viewable on phones, desktops, or VR headsets)
- Interactive VR games and apps (often shown via gameplay or walkthroughs)
- Tutorials on building VR content or reviewing VR hardware

VR content can be cinematic, educational, or just plain fun. It’s a growing niche as more people get access to affordable headsets like Meta Quest, PlayStation VR, and Apple Vision Pro.

Types of VR content include:

- **360° storytelling** – Immersive documentaries, travel, or narrative shorts
- **VR gameplay** – Letting viewers experience new games or hardware
- **Tech reviews** – Covering the latest VR headsets, controllers, and accessories
- **Tutorials** – Teaching how to create VR content or use VR tools

## Why VR Videos Work Online

- They’re highly immersive and make viewers feel like they’re “inside” the story
- They showcase cutting-edge technology, which attracts early adopters and tech fans
- They’re visually unique, standing out in feeds and recommendations
- They encourage interaction (move your phone, drag the video, or use a headset)
