## What Are Stop Motion Videos?

Stop motion videos are a type of animation where physical objects are photographed one frame at a time while being moved in small increments. When the sequence of photos is played as a video, the objects appear to move on their own.

Unlike computer animation, stop motion has a tactile, handcrafted quality. It can be playful, surreal, or cinematic depending on how it’s used. This is why stop motion is popular for everything from children’s stories to experimental art and even commercials.

Stop motion comes in several styles:

-   **Claymation** – Animating clay figures (e.g. Wallace & Gromit).
    
-   **Lego/Brickfilms** – Animating Lego minifigures and sets, a massive YouTube niche.
    
-   **Cut-out animation** – Using paper or flat objects (like South Park’s early episodes).
    
-   **Everyday object animation** – Bringing to life mugs, pencils, or food items.
    
-   **Puppet/figure animation** – Using dolls, toys, or custom-built puppets.
    

Because of this variety, stop motion can appeal to multiple audiences: kids, hobbyists, filmmakers, and even marketers.
