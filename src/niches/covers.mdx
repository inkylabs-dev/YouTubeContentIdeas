- **Creative Expression:** Covers allow artists to add their own style, arrangement, and personality.  
- **Evergreen Appeal:** Well-done covers continue to gain views over time.  
- **Collaboration Potential:** Duets and collabs with other musicians expand reach and audience.  

## Types of Music Cover Content

Stripped-down versions of songs with guitar, piano, or simple arrangements.
