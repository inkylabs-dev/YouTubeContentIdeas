            Chasing keywords alone can feel like a grind. The real secret? Package

        <h3>Turn One Idea Into a Whole Series</h3>
        <p>
            Here‚Äôs my favorite hack: stretch one idea into a 10‚Äì20 video series.
            Viewers love consistency, and you‚Äôll save yourself tons of brainstorming
            time. Formats like ‚Äú7-day challenges,‚Äù makeovers, or comparison battles
            work super well here.

            <li>Build episodes that leave people wanting more</li>

            <li>Repurpose content into Shorts &amp; community posts</li>
