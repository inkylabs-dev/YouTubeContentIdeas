              Content creation is hard enough. Finding fresh, engaging ideas shouldn't be another barrier between creators and their audience. That's why we built this inventory of YouTube ideas to serve the public, for good.

            <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground mb-8">
              Too many platforms lock valuable resources behind subscription walls, limiting access to those who can afford premium plans. We reject this approach. Creativity thrives when knowledge flows freely.

            <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              We realize the coming evolution of AI technology and plan to add more personalized idea brainstorming features. But here's our core belief: AI should be a "copilot," not a replacement for human creativity.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              The magic happens when human intuition meets AI assistance. We're building tools that amplify your creative voice, not silence it. Our upcoming features will help you:
            </p>
            
            <ul class="text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Generate personalized content ideas based on your niche</li>
              <li>Analyze trending topics in your field</li>
              <li>Brainstorm unique angles for popular concepts</li>
              <li>Discover content gaps in your posting schedule</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground mb-8">
              But you'll always be in the driver's seat. AI will suggest, you'll create.
            </p>

              This project is built with transparency and community collaboration in mind. We believe the best tools are built together, by creators, for creators.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground mb-6">
              Every line of code, every content idea, every feature decision is made with one question in mind: Does this help creators tell better stories?
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-muted-foreground">
              Help us keep creativity free and accessible. Whether you're a developer, content creator, or someone who believes in open access to knowledge, there's a place for you in our community. Together, we're building something bigger than a toolâ€”we're fostering a movement where great ideas flow freely and creativity knows no bounds.
